# LASSO_methodology
## Abstract
The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, Lasso, simplifies the regression model by shrinking the insignificant coefficients to zero and thus making the model more interpretable, by selecting only the most relevant coefficients. It is very useful for a complicated model with large
number of coefficients, as too many features in a model can cause over-fitting, affecting the predicting power of the model. Lasso methodology improves the prediction accuracy of a modelnby avoiding over-fitting. We will see how such an optimal model is chosen and study the lasso steps, and gain an understanding of how lasso method is performed and used to improve the model prediction.
We will gain an understanding of the calculations involved in the lasso process, understand the methodology and try to formulate a collection of algorithms that helps us to perform the lasso steps from scratch.
An applied example of performing the lasso algorithm steps on a synthetic data-set is discussed, showing all the intermediate steps in detail, to reproduce the results, as given by using the lars package in R.
